# dog_breed_classifier


The Dog Breed Classifier App is a Flutter-based mobile application that utilizes the TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) package and a pre-trained model to classify dog breeds. Given an input image, the app predicts the most likely dog breed from a list of 60 supported breeds. It provides users with an interactive and user-friendly interface to quickly identify and learn about different dog breeds.

# Features
Image Classification: The app employs a deep learning model to classify dog breeds based on input images.
Pre-trained Model: It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model trained on a diverse dataset of 60 different dog breeds.
Interactive UI: The app offers an intuitive user interface for capturing or selecting images and displaying the predicted breed result.
Breed Information: Users can access additional information about each predicted breed, including a brief description, temperament, and origin.
Offline Functionality: The classification process works even without an active internet connection.
Please note that while the app can accurately classify dog breeds it was trained on, it may not provide accurate predictions for dog breeds that were not included in the training data. Additionally, it does not detect the presence of a dog in an image. The app focuses solely on identifying the breed if a dog is present in the image.

# Example Usage
Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use the Dog Breed Classifier App:

    - Launch the app on your mobile device.
    - Either take a photo of a dog or select an existing image from your device's gallery.
    - The app will analyze the image and display the predicted dog breed.

# Requirements
To run the Dog Breed Classifier App, ensure that you have:

    - A compatible mobile device running Android 10 (Quince Tart) or later.
    - Sufficient storage space on your device to install the app.
    - A stable internet connection to download and install the necessary dependencies.
